This repository contains a R script to extract data from "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones". Added descriptive Activity names according to Activity codes and grouped the data according to the 30 test subjects. Final tidy data set contains averaged mean and standard deviation of each subject according to the activity.


This repository containts run_analysis.R file which contains the code to label the data set with descriptive activity names and outputs a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This script is heavily commented with what each step is intended for.
